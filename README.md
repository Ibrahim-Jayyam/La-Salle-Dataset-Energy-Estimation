# La-Salle-Dataset-Energy-Estimation
Data Set used for the analysis and estimation of performance indexes in energy systems

# Context
In this work, a method involves finding underlying patterns in a dataset and contains samples from the NOVALYNX 110-WS-18 weather station. Initially, this data is normalized, cleaned, and prepared. Then, the most relevant features are selected, and the basic statistical properties, such as maximum and minimum values, standard deviation and mean are calculated.

Some relevant columns in the normalized dataset:

Date - The date of the observation
Time Ok - Format hour
WS - Wind Speed in $\frac{m}{s}$
SR - Solar Radiation in $\frac{W}{m^2}$
TP - Temperature in Â°C

This data set corresponds to two different date time starting on December 13th, 2018, at 2:30 am until March 9th, 2020,  at 6:40 pm.
